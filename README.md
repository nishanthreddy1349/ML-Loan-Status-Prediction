# Loan Status Predicition

#Problem Statement : There is a Finance company wants to automate the loan approval process. So we have created a machine learning model which pridicts wheather the customer's loan is approved or rejected by the inputs which they have given. Customers will have to fill a form and using that inputs the comany will be predicting whether the loan is approved or not.


#Approach : We have a dataset which consits of data filled by the customer we have used that data and we have done some data processing to that dataset. Then we split our refined data into train and test data which will be used to train and test our model.


#Machine Learning Model Used : Support Vector Machine Model
